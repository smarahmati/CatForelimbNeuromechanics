    sequence.

    -   \"WI\" and \"VI\" (same): Muscle Via-point to Muscle Insertion

**Description of Each Part**

**A) Muscle Length and Moment Arm**

-   **A1 - Musculoskeletal data**

    -   Scripts:

        -   [A_MusculoskeletalSystem_SagittalPlane](https://github.com/smarahmati/CatForelimbNeuromechanics/tree/master/Codes/A%29%20Muscle%20length%20and%20moment%20arm/A1%20-%20Musculoskeletal%20data):
            Loads data from Excel sheets containing your experimental
            data (musculoskeletal information). It performs the
            following:

            -   Extracts muscle origin and insertion points, joint
                centers, and other relevant anatomical data.

            -   Fits a plane to the attachment points using Principal
                Component Analysis (PCA) and projects anatomical
                landmarks for accurate spatial representation.

            -   Plots the muscles and segments in a 3D figure,
                visualizing the fitted plane, annotating muscles and
                attachment points, and highlighting key anatomical
                features.
